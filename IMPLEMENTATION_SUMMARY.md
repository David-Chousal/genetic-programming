# Genetic Algorithm Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete genetic algorithm system that evolves a population of digital "lifeforms" to discover optimal solutions through natural selection, genetic crossover, and random mutation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. DNA Class (`dna.h` / `dna.cxx`)
The DNA class represents genetic information using 16-bit binary codes.

**Key Features:**
- `Gene` type: `unsigned short` (16 bits)
- Constructor: Creates DNA from integer value or randomly
- `getCode(i)`: Retrieves bit value at position i
- `setCode(i, v)`: Sets bit value at position i
- `size()`: Returns DNA length (16)
- `count()`: Counts number of 1-bits in the DNA
- `matchDNA(other)`: Compares two DNA strands and returns number of matching bits

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses bitwise operations for efficient bit manipulation
- Bounds checking with exception handling
- Uses `std::bitset` for counting operations

### 2. Life Class (`life.h` / `life.cxx`)
Represents an individual lifeform with 2 chromosomes (DNA strands).

**Key Features:**
- `cross(other)`: Creates offspring through genetic crossover
- `dnaMatch(c, other)`: Compares chromosome c with another DNA
- Tracks generation number for evolutionary lineage
- Maintains fitness score from competitions

**Crossover Implementation:**
- For each bit in each chromosome:
  - 1% chance: Random mutation (introduces new genetic material)
  - 99% chance: Randomly inherit from one parent or the other
- Offspring generation = max(parent1, parent2) + 1
- This implements **uniform crossover with mutation**

### 3. Arena Class (`arena.h` / `arena.cxx`)
Orchestrates the evolutionary process for 1000 individuals.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- `compete()`: Each individual attempts problem-solving 10 times per round
- `evolve()`: Selection and breeding for next generation
  - Keep individuals with above-average scores
  - Breed offspring from winners to repopulate
  - Reset scores for new generation
- `matured()`: Checks if population has evolved sufficiently (90% threshold)
- `highGeneration()`: Tracks maximum generation number
- `averageScore()`: Monitors population fitness

### 4. Select Class (`select.h` / `select.cxx`)
Defines the fitness function and problem to solve.

**Fitness Evaluation:**
- Favored genetic patterns: chromosome 0 = `0x0f`, chromosome 1 = `0xf0`
- `matchRatio()`: Calculates percentage of genes matching favored pattern
- `play()`: Scores individuals based on:
  - How well genes match favored pattern
  - Random "luck" element (-100 to +100)
  - Formula: `(matchRatio - 0.5) * 30 + luck`

**Bug Fix:**
- Fixed `maxMatches` calculation to use `DNA.size()` (16) instead of `count()` of 1-bits
- This ensures proper normalization of match ratios

### 5. Unit Tests (`dnamain.cxx`)
Comprehensive test suite for DNA class with 8 test categories:

1. **Constructor Test**: Validates DNA creation with specific bit patterns
2. **Size Test**: Verifies DNA length is always 16
3. **Get/Set Test**: Tests bit manipulation operations
4. **Count Test**: Validates 1-bit counting accuracy
5. **Match Test**: Verifies DNA comparison logic
6. **Boundary Test**: Tests error handling for invalid indices
7. **Random Test**: Validates random DNA generation
8. **Complex Operations Test**: Tests sequential bit manipulations

**All tests passed successfully! ✓**

### 6. Build System (`Makefile`)
Updated Makefile with two build targets:

- `make genetic`: Builds main evolution simulator
- `make dnatest`: Builds DNA unit test program
- `make all`: Builds both executables
- `make clean`: Removes all build artifacts

### Genetic Algorithm Evolution
The population successfully evolved over **68 generations**:

| Generation | Average Score | Maturity |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| 0          | -1.00         | 0.5007   |
| 10         | 27.04         | 0.5874   |
| 20         | 47.19         | 0.6783   |
| 30         | 69.48         | 0.7388   |
| 40         | 84.61         | 0.7856   |
| 50         | 98.04         | 0.8376   |
| 60         | 114.49        | 0.8794   |
| 68         | 129.10        | 0.9031   |

**Key Observations:**
- Started at ~50% maturity (random genes)
- Steadily improved through natural selection
- Reached 90% maturity threshold at generation 68
- Average scores increased from negative to 129+
- Demonstrates successful convergence to optimal solution

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Natural Selection
- Individuals with better-matching genes score higher
- Above-average individuals are selected for breeding
- Poor performers are eliminated (culled)

### 2. Genetic Crossover
- Offspring inherit genes from both parents
- Random bit-by-bit selection creates new combinations
- Preserves good genes while exploring variations

### 3. Random Mutation
- 1% chance per bit per offspring
- Introduces genetic diversity
- Prevents convergence to local optima
- Allows discovery of solutions not in initial population

### 4. Fitness Function
- Measures how well an individual solves the problem
- Based on matching favored genetic patterns
- Includes randomness to simulate nature
- Drives the direction of evolution

### 5. Population Dynamics
- Large population (1000) maintains genetic diversity
- Multiple competitions per generation (10) reduce noise
- Generational tracking shows evolutionary progress
- Maturity metric measures convergence
